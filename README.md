# Belly Button Diversity Dashboard using Plotly

## Project Overview

Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis. <br>
This project is an example dashboard/website using Plotly to display charts based on data collected from volunteers. In this specific project, I helped develop an interactive webpage that keeps track of results from a belly button bacteria data collection from volunteers. The dashboard includes demographic data of the volunteers and the different species collected from their belly button. The data of belly button bacteria is hypothesized as something that can use for manufacture synthesized beef.
As disclaimer, this project is for school and the data and hyothesis are not real.
